I've fixed why you couldn't see the new columns! 🕵️‍♂️

**The Issue:**
Your previous saved settings for "Order Items" were locked in, so the system didn't think it needed to show you the new options (`Downpayment` and `Remaining Balance`) that I just added.

**The Fix:**
I've updated the settings screen to always check for **new** available columns and merge them into your list.

Please open **Configure Columns > Order Items** again. You should see them at the bottom now! ✨
